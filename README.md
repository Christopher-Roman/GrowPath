# GrowPath

### Description

Gardening is a lot of fun. It is a great hobby that offers people an opportunity to nurture a living organism and watch it grow without all of the commitment of a pet. Gardeners are also able to directly impact the way their plant grows through training, feeding, environment and so much more. But, how do you remember everything youâ€™ve done over the course of a month, or three months, or a year? What if something you did impacted the plant in a miraculously amazing way? Or, what if it had a negative impact? You could just write it down on a white board or start a note on your phone. Maybe put a post-it somewhere? But, what happens when you need it? Did you remember to put the date on it? Which plant was that post-it about? GrowPath will timestampe entries to specific plants. Efficiently and effectively create data points for each of your plants to bring your gardening game to the next level!

### User Story

#### MVP Functionality:

-Users will be able to add plants to track
-Users will be able choose what type of entry they are making for a specific plant (i.e. feeding, watering, defoil, etc).
-Users will be able to list all entries for a single plant in their garden and sort based on entry type.
-Users will have full CRUD on all entries and plants added to their profile.
-Users will be able to attach pictures to their entries.
-Users will be able to use the app to find information about their plants using API calls

#### Post-MVP Functionality:

-Users will be able to utilize other accounts to log in utilizing oAuth
-Users will be able to set reminder  email/calendar/notifications to care for their plants
-Users will be able to export plant data to Excel spreadsheets

#### Future Commercial Use Functionality:

-Machine learning to offer suggestions based on data entries
-Camera integration and photo recognition to find and treat unhealthy plants or pests
-Smart devices to control grow environment (i.e. temperature, RH, pH levels, etc)
-Smart irrigation dashboard

### App Tech

-Ruby on Rails
-PostgreSQL
-React Native
